INTRODUCTION:<br>
In this article, the task is to implement a basic Snake Game. Below given some functionalities of this game:<br>

The snake is represented with a 0(zero) symbol.<br>
The fruit is represented with an *(asterisk) symbol.<br>
The snake can move in any direction according to the user with the help of the keyboard (W, A, S, D keys).<br>
When the snake eats a fruit the score will increase by 10 points.<br>
The fruit will generate automatically within the boundaries.<br>
Whenever the snake will touch the boundary the game is over.<br>

Steps to create this game:<br>

There will be four user-defined functions.<br>
Build a boundary within which the game will be played.<br>
The eggs are generated randomly.<br>
Then increase the score whenever the snake eats a egg.<br>
The user-defined functions created in this program are given below:<br>

Draw(): This function creates the boundary in which the game will be played.<br>
Setup(): This function will set the position of the fruit within the boundary.<br>
Input(): This function will take the input from the keyboard.<br>
Logic(): This function will set the movement of the snake.<br>
